# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a user library within JavaScript. This can be used to created apps, without starting from scratch every single time, it basically has the bare bones of a structure of which you then build your app around. One of the syntax difference between HTML and JSX is how you assign a class to an element, in HTML it is simply class= "" in JSX it is className= ""

Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extention of JavaScript. With JSX we are able to embed JavaScript objects within an HTML element.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is a function that we can use to test our code to see if it will work as it should. Also, yarn can be used to create an app that we can run on our local server so we can see the app and how it changes as we begin to write our code.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manger that installs a piece of code from a global registry onto the local computer. Yarn was designed to have clean output logs for easy understandability. Yarn stores dependencies locally. Yarn generates a yarn.lock file. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function is when you need a function to run but you don't give put anything in it. This is done by using an empty (). 

Researched answer: An anonymous function is when a function has been declared, however the function doesn't have a name. Anonymous functions can have multiple arguments, but only one expression. It is not accessable after its initial creation.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are consistent, they don't change. Props aka (properties) can change. For example, if you have a cup of water, the state of that substance will always be water. However, you can change the propety of that water if you freeze it it will become ice, and if you boil it it will become steam... but the state of that substance will always remain water.

Researched answer: The state is controlled by the component, while props are controlled by whatever renders the comonent. Props will get data from an external source. States manage the internal data.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM is basically our visual experience of the code. Everything we see on the screen, our mouse cursor scrolling across the page, clicking on something.... these are all examples of DOM.

Researched answer: Document Object Model (DOM) defines how the browser reads your document and will creating a visual representation of what it reads.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div is used to create dividers within a code. By basically diving the code into sections, it makes the code easier to work with and understand. This is helpful for things such as easier readabilty, accessabilty, styling, etc. 

Researched answer: A div is a generic block level element used to divide a page into blocks. Mostly used for organizational purposes. A span is an inline element used to styling without dividing things into blocks. For example, if you had a the word "Mississippi" and you wanted to change the color of the text for only a few of the letters you would simply use a span element and place the letters that you want your styling to apply to within the span.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: I'ts a programming model which organizes software design around data and objects instead of functions and logic.

2. Ruby: It is a general programming language with an emphasis on productivity and simplicity. It was designed to be natural and intuitive.

3. Implicit return: When values of a function are returned without using the keyword "return".

4. Ruby blocks: they are annonymous functions are are passed into methods. They are enclosed in a do / end statement or between {}.

5. Ruby hashes: A ruby hash is data that is stored by associated keys.
